Hello. I am Md Fakhrul Islam Sojib. Currently doing undergrad in SUST, Bangladesh and doing competetive programming.
I am learning data structures and algorithms on a regular basis.
Nowadays i've been trying to figure out some basic sectors of CS like operating system, network, system design, database, etc.
